This CronFormField package is written in Dart for the Flutter. You can edit cron expressions with this form field in an alert dialog. This widget extends TextField to have more useful behavior. It supports both Standard and Quartz cron expressions with allowed and alternative values.

## Usage

In the `pubspec.yaml` of your flutter project, add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  ...
  cron_form_field: "^0.6.0"
```

In your library add the following import:

```dart
import 'package:cron_form_field/cron_form_field.dart';
```

For help getting started with Flutter, view the online [documentation](https://flutter.io/).

## Example

``` dart
CronFormField(
  initialValue: '0 0 */3 ? * * *',
  // controller: _cronController,
  labelText: 'Schedule',
  onChanged: (val) => print(val),
  onSaved: (val) => print(val),
  // outputFormat: CronExpressionOutputFormat.AUTO
);
```

The result of val in `onChanged`, `validator` and `onSaved` will be a String.
